# AI Medibot

AI Medibot is an intelligent medical assistant powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It allows users to ask questions through a Streamlit-based UI, referencing a set of textbooks to generate accurate, explainable, and citation-backed answers using a local language model and vector database.

## üß† Key Features

- **Natural Language Q&A Interface**: Ask medical questions via a user-friendly Streamlit interface.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Utilizes local `ollama` with the DeepSeek R1 model for efficient and private inference.
- **Textbook-Centric Reasoning**: Answers include:
  - Model's reasoning
  - Referenced textbook name
  - Page number(s) of source
- **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully responds with _"I don't know"_ when no valid answer is found.
- **Local Embedding and Storage**: PDF textbooks are embedded using Nomic and stored in a local ChromaDB instance for fast retrieval.
